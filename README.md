# MNIST Digit Classifier

This is the model wherein i have trained Neural Networks on the MNIST dataset to predict the handwritten digit

This repo has 2 code files :
1. MNIST-Digit-Classifier\Classifier-from-scratch.ipynb : In this a neural network is made from numpy and pandas only and using the fundamentals of backpropagation the model is trained, achieving 92% accuracy

2. MNIST-Digit-Classifier\Classifier-using-Keras.ipynb : In this a neural network and a Convulutional neural network is made using keras and many advanced optimization techniques to imptore accuracy, achieving 97.3% and 98.3% respectively.
